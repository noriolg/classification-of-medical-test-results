This project was started in December 2019 with the aim of classifying images of test results as positive/negative and non-conclusive. 
It was not related with COVID. However, the images taken are very similar to some of the COVID testing tools and I think that it 
could useful for classifying COVID results as well.

This is part of a larger design project that involved the use of a rapsberry Pi to take pictures, process them and light the corresponding LED
with the classification. That code is not uploaded here for simplicity and modularity as I think this notebook contains the information that could
be most relevant to other people.
